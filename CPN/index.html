    <h1>Computational Process Networks</h1>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    Computational Process Networks is a model and a framework library for real-time high-throughput signal and image processing. The model combines:
    <ul>
      <li>Process Networks [1], a formal, concurrent model for functional parallelism</li>
      <li>Bounded Scheduling [2] for realization in finite memory</li>
      <li>Firing Thresholds from Computation Graphs [3]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Computational Process Networks model algorithms on overlapping continuous streams of data (such as digital filters and overlap-and-save fast Fourier transforms), and provides liveness and determinate execution. Our C++ implementation provides a portable, high-performance, scalable framework using POSIX Threads.</p>
    <p>The March 2000 issue of <i>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</i> contains a paper <a href="file:///Users/allen/Sites/public_html/TransSP-Mar00/index.html">[4]</a> which prototypes a 3-D sonar beamfomer using Computational Process Networks. The beamfomer sustains a real-time 4 GFLOPS on a Sun Ultra Enterprise 4000 with 12 336 MHz UltraSPARC-II processors.</p>
    <p>The Computational Process Network source code is publicly available, under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>Original releases of CPN worked only on symmetric multiprocessing workstations. It is <a href="../CPNSourceCode">available here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    We are in the process of a complete rewrite of the CPN framework, adding the capability for execution on a distributed network of computers, as well as distributed dynamic deadlock detection and resolution (D4R). D4R algorithm examples are <a href="../D4R/">available here</a>.<br>

      The CPN framework source code is available <a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/gallen/CPN/cpn-20061110.tgz">here</a>. It is currently in a pre-alpha state. We are working to make an updated release shortly.<br>
