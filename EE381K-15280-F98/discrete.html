<H1><CENTER>Discrete-time beamforming</CENTER></H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to implement beamforming in digital systems, we
   must sample the received signals in time, at t = n<FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>.
   Now in our digital delay-and-sum, our time delays <FONT FACE="Symbol">t</FONT><SUB>i</SUB>
   must be quantized to the nearest sample. (Note that in these
   diagram, alphas are the shading coefficients rather than the
   slowness vector.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>These quantization errors in the time delay perterb the
   array pattern. In general, the sensors must be sampled at a rate
   much greater than the Nyquist rate to approximate the time delays
   required for beam steering. To handle the high bandwidth and large
   number of elements needed for high resolution sonar, the necessary
   sampling rate is quite large. These high sampling rates impose
   requirements on the A/D converters and on the bandwidth of the
   cables which connect the A/D converters to the beamformer. Large
   amounts of memory are also required to handle the long delays
   associated with large arrays and high sample rates. Because of the
   high implementation cost, digital interpolation beamformers are
   generally used instead.
   
   <H2><CENTER>Digital Interpolation Beamforming</CENTER></H2>
   
   <P>Now we sample at just above the Nyquist rate, and achieve the
   desired time-delay resolution by digital interpolation of the
   sampled data.</P>

   <P>In the above digital system, the sensors are sampled at the
   interval <FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>, needed to satisfy the
   Nyquist criterion. In the beamformer, digital interpolation is
   performed to the interval <FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>, where
   <FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT> = L <FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>, and
   L is an integer larger than one. Now time delays are quantized to
   integer multiples of <FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>, i.e.,
   <FONT FACE="Symbol">t</FONT><SUB>i</SUB> =
   N<SUB>i</SUB><FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>.</P>
   
   <P>In a wideband sonar, the digital interpolation beamformer
   technique relaxes specifications on the A/D conversion rate and
   data transmission bandwidth at the expense of additional
   computation for digital interpolation. Beam degradation introduced
   by interpolation is controllable and quite small for an
   interpolation filter of modest design.</P>
   
   <H3><CENTER>Digital Interpolation</CENTER></H3>
   
   <P>Digital interpolation is a two-step process: zero-insertion and
   then lowpass filtering. Since the filter and the summation are
   both linear, the filter can be placed either before or after the
   beamformer summation.</P>
   
   <P>The first step of interpolation, zero-insertion, involves
   transforming the digital stream x<SUB>m</SUB>(n<FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>)
   by inserting L-1 zeros after each sample. The resulting stream
   x<SUB>m</SUB>(n<FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>) has L times more
   samples, and has had its sampling period reduced by a factor of
   L.</P>
   
   <CENTER><IMG SRC="Graphics/digitalInterpolation.gif" WIDTH=396 HEIGHT=77 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>
   
   <P>To complete the interpolation, an ideal digital lowpass filter
   with a cutoff frequency at <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT> = ¹/L is
   required. Filtering the stream x<SUB>m</SUB>(n<FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>)
   yields the interpolated approximation to the input sampled at the
   interval <FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>. Since FIR filters are not
   ideal, error is introduced at the beamformer output. Increasing
   the number of filter coefficients reduces this error, so there is
   a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity.</P>
   
   <H2><CENTER>Frequency-Domain Beamforming for Discrete-Time
   Signals</CENTER></H2>
   
   <P>Again, frequency-domain beamforming is inherently narrowband.
   The discrete-time frequency-domain beamformer output is given
   by</P>
   
   <CENTER><IMG SRC="Graphics/discreteFreqBmfr.gif" WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=58 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>
   
   <P>Note that the factor R<SUB>i</SUB>(n<FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>,<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>)exp(j<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>n<FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>)
   can be efficiently calculated for many values of <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>
   with a 1-D FFT.</P>
   
   <P>Since the beam has been formed in the frequency domain, the
   steering delays <FONT FACE="Symbol">t</FONT><SUB>i</SUB> do
   <I>not</I> have to be quantized.</P>
   
   <P>For the special case of equally spaced linear arrays, the
   discrete frequency-domain beamformer output can be computed by
   applying a 2-D DFT directly to the receiver signals
   r<SUB>i</SUB>(n<FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
