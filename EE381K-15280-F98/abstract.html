<BLOCKQUOTE>We first give an overview of continuous-time and
   discrete-time approaches to beamforming. Beamforming is a signal
   processing technique applied to the data received by an array of
   sensors to detect and locate objects in an environment, e.g.
   locating whales using sonar. Beamformers use the spatial and
   temporal information to improve source localization. In
   discrete-time beamformers, the data is sampled in space and time.
   We can use additional time samples (snapshots) to improve
   resolution. After the overview, we will discuss real-time
   implementations of sonar beamformers, which require several GFLOPS
   of computation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
