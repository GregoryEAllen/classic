   <P>Real-time data-intensive systems such as sonar beamformers and
   synthetic aperture radar processors have traditionally required
   implementation in expensive custom hardware. Current systems use
   off-the-shelf programmable processors in customized configurations
   to reduce development cost. To reduce development cost and time
   further, we consider the use of workstations as the target
   architecture and design environment. We present a general approach
   for realizing real-time data-intensive systems in software on a
   multiprocessor workstation.</P>
   
   <P>First, we present several dataflow models which are commonly
   used to describe systems of this nature. Second, we present a
   framework for developing scalable software implementations of
   signal and image processing systems on workstations. The framework
   models the concurrency and parallelism in these systems using
   Process Networks. The Process Network model guarantees determinate
   execution of concurrent programs regardless of the scheduling
   algorithm used. We employ a scheduling algorithm that always finds
   a bounded execution if one exists. Third, we implement the
   framework in C++ using lightweight real-time POSIX threads.</P>
   
   <P>We use two case studies to evaluate the performance of our
   framework: a high-resolution 3-D sonar beamformer, and a synthetic
   aperture radar processor. On a Sun Ultra Enterprise workstation,
   the 4-GFLOP beamformer exhibits near-linear speedup using 1 to 12
   processors and executes in real-time with 12 336-MHz UltraSPARC-II
   processors.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
