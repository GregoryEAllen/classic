# Greg Allen's classic `public_html`

This is my classic `public_html` repository, originally started in graduate school and created in [Claris Home Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claris_Home_Page). It was also maintained for awhile with [SeaMonkey](https://www.seamonkey-project.org) until I fell back to just editing the html.

It spent a long time as a [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) repository. Maybe it was CVS or subversion before that, I don't really remember. Like everything else, eventually it made it to git.

It's been hosted far and wide as hosting sites have come and gone. It spent a long time hosted from the [ECE department](https://www.ece.utexas.edu) in `~allen`, and later moved to [webspace.utexas.edu](https://webspace.utexas.edu). It did a long stint at [gallen.bitbucket.io](https://gallen.bitbucket.io) until it was the victim of their restructuring. It also spent a long time on my Mac at home, served up with [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org).

With any luck, it can stay at [GregoryEAllen.github.io/classic](https://GregoryEAllen.github.io/classic) for a long, long time. But my new content is going on [GregoryEAllen.github.io](https://GregoryEAllen.github.io), written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

For that classic look and remarkable location stability, you can't beat the page of [Prof. Brian Evans](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~bevans/), my Ph.D. advisor.
