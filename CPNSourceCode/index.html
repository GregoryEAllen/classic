<blockquote>Computational Process Networks is a model and a framework
library for real-time high-throughput signal and image processing on
symmetric multiprocessing workstations. The model combines:
  <ul>
    <li>Process Networks [1], a formal, concurrent model for functional
parallelism</li>
    <li>Bounded Scheduling [2] for realization in finite memory</li>
    <li>Firing Thresholds from Computation Graphs [3]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Computational Process Networks model algorithms on overlapping
continuous streams of data (such as digital filters and
overlap-and-save fast Fourier transforms), and provides liveness and
determinate execution. Our C++ implementation provides a portable,
high-performance, scalable framework using POSIX Threads.</p>
  <p>The March 2000 issue of <i>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</i>
contains a paper <a href="../TransSP-Mar00/index.html">[4]</a> which
prototypes a 3-D sonar beamfomer using Computational Process Networks.
The beamfomer sustains a real-time 4 GFLOPS on a Sun Ultra Enterprise
4000 with 12 336 MHz UltraSPARC-II processors.</p>
  <p>The Computational Process Network source code is publicly
available, under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/%7Ejmake/">jmake</a>,
an
automated, multi-platform build tool. You'll need it,
too.</p>

<blockquote>A core component of the Computational Process Network
framework is the <a href="Pthread.tar.gz">Pthread class library</a>.
It is developed on Sun Solaris, and runs (or has run) on many other
platforms. These platforms include Linux, LinuxPPC, AIX, IRIX,
MercuryOS, and MacOS X DP3. Other platforms which support POSIX
Pthreads should also work with minimal effort.
  <p>The <a href="CPNSample.tgz">Computational Process Network Sample
code</a> contains the Pthread library. It contains a simple program
which demonstrates the use of the Computational Process Network
framework, while attempting to test it. Currently, it has only been
tested on Solaris, Linux, and LinuxPPC (but may work on others).</p>
  <p>3/29/00 - This version has had a significant rewrite, with the
following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>improved portability</li>
    <li>the virtual memory manager interface has been split into its
own class</li>
    <li>queues can have multiple channels</li>
    <li>queues know how to grow (but not when)</li>
    <li>a few performace tweaks in the queues</li>
    <li>some depricated APIs in the queues [ EnqueueThreshold(),
DequeueThreshold() ]</li>
    <li>the move to the name "Computational Process Networks"</li>
  </ul>
