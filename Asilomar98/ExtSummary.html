<BLOCKQUOTE>A beamformer is a spatial filter that operates on the
   output of an array of sensors in order to enhance the amplitude of
   a coherent wavefront relative to background noise and directional
   interference. Time-domain beamforming delays and adds weighted
   outputs of an array of transducers. A digital implementation is
   created by sampling the output of each sensor element in time.
   These sets of discrete samples are again delayed and summed in the
   beamforming operation. Typically, the delay resolution required
   for beam steering is much greater than that given by the Nyquist
   sample rate. In digital interpolation beamforming, the desired
   time-delay quantization is achieved by digital interpolation of
   data sampled slightly above the Nyquist rate.
   
   <P>Traditionally, custom hardware has been required to implement
   processing-intensive sonar beamforming algorithms in real-time.
   However, the performance of today's symmetric multiprocessing UNIX
   workstations makes it possible to implement these algorithms at a
   fraction of the development and manufacturing costs of a custom
   hardware solution. In order to facilitate the implementation, a
   reliable formal design methodology for organizing and developing
   real-time multiprocessor software is needed. We develop a sonar
   beamformer in software by merging the following recent
   technologies: (1) symmetric multiprocessing on Unix workstations,
   (2) lightweight POSIX threads, and (3) the Process Network model
   of computation.</P>
   
   <P>The Process Network model of computation is a key part of our
   design methodology, and is natural for capturing the concurrency
   and parallelism in signal processing systems. The model represents
   a program in directed graph notation, where each node represents
   an independent process and each edge represents a one-way FIFO
   queue of data to be communicated. This model provides for
   correctness, and guarantees determinate execution of the program
   regardless of the scheduling algorithm used. Dynamic scheduling
   based on the availability of data allows execution in bounded
   memory. This bounded memory Process Network model is well-suited
   for implementation using the thread model of concurrent
   programming.</P>
   
   <P>The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a recent
   standard with the goal of providing source-code portability across
   many UNIX platforms. Implementing the Process Network model with
   POSIX threads (Pthreads) gives a low-overhead, high-performance,
   scalable framework. Symmetric multiprocessing guarantees efficient
   utilization of multiple processors, as scheduling of Pthreads is
   dynamically handled by the operating system. POSIX optionally
   allows Pthreads to be scheduled with real-time priority.</P>
   
   <P>Our Process Network framework was developed in C++ on Sun
   Solaris workstations. A core component of our implementation is
   the high-performance Process Network queue class. This queue class
   is intended to make up for the lack of circular address buffers on
   general purpose processors, and to adhere to the scheduling rules
   for bounded execution of a computation graph: (1) consumer threads
   block when attempting to read from a queue with insufficient data,
   and (2) producer threads block when attempting to write to a queue
   which is full. To reduce data copying, both producers and
   consumers operate directly out of queue memory.</P>
   
   <P>We compare the performance of batch-mode and Process Network
   beamformers, in order to evaluate Process Network overhead. We
   implement a multi-fan digital interpolation beamformer using a
   Process Network, and find that it is feasible for this 4-GFLOP
   algorithm to run in real-time on a Sun workstation with 16
   UltraSPARC-II processors running at 300 MHz. The software
   beamformer reduces manufacturing costs, development costs, and
   development time by a factor of three, and volume and weight by a
   factor two, over an equivalent modern hardware beamformer.</P>
   
   <P>Although our Process Network implementation has been applied to
   digital interpolation beamforming, this is not its only possible
   use -- many processing-intensive DSP algorithms could benefit from
   this methodology. Design and verification can be performed on less
   powerful workstations, with reasonable assuredness that
   performance will increase linearly with the number of CPUs, taking
   advantage of the parallelism that exists in the algorithms.
   Systems developed in this manner would be deployable and real-time
   capable when given sufficient computing resources.&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

   Network is a concurrent model that guarantees determinate
   execution (i.e., no artificial deadlock) in bounded memory if a
   bounded memory realization exists. Lightweight threads provide a
   low-overhead, high-performance, scalable framework. Symmetric
   multiprocessing guarantees efficient utilization of multiple
   processors, as scheduling of threads is dynamically handled by the
   operating system. We compare the performance of batch-mode and
