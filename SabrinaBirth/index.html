<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Sabrina Fair Llorens Allen</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>born Friday, May 30, 1997 at 12:30 PM</B></P>

<P><A HREF="WideAwake.jpg"><IMG SRC="WideAwakeSmall.jpg" WIDTH=235 HEIGHT=110 ALIGN=bottom></A><A HREF="BabyFace.jpg"><IMG SRC="BabyFaceSmall.jpg" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=114 ALIGN=bottom></A></P>

<P><B>7 pounds, 2.4 ounces; 20 inches long</B></P>

<P>Sabrina was born with lots of blonde hair, and dark blue (almost
navy) eyes.</P>

<P>Sabrina didn't handle mommy's contractions very well, so the
doctor decided it would be safest to take her out early. Labor was
induced at 6AM, and 6.5 hours later we had a baby girl! She is not a
small baby -- just imagine how big she would be if she had gotten
several more weeks of growth!</P>

<P>We delivered at <A HREF="http://www.goodhealth.com/">Seton
Northwest Hospital</A>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Naming Sabrina</B></FONT></P>

<P>Call us saps, but the first movie we saw together was <A HREF="http://voyager.paramount.com/sabrina/">Sabrina</A>,
starring <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Actors_and_Actresses/Ford__Harrison/">Harrison
Ford</A> and <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Actors_and_Actresses/Ormond__Julia/">Julia
Ormond</A>. We also played music from the <A HREF="http://www.sestran.com/~accaaa/sabrina.html">soundtrack</A>
at our wedding.</P>

<P>In the movie, Sabrina recites the poem after which she is
named:</P></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><I>Sabrina fair
&nbsp; &nbsp; Listen where thou art sitting
Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,
&nbsp; &nbsp; In twisted braids of lilies knitting
The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Listen for dear honour's sake,
&nbsp; &nbsp; Goddess of the silver lake,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen and save.</I></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

John Milton: <B>Comus </B>(c.1637)</A>

<P>(Besides, it was one of the few names we could both agree upon
:-)</P>
