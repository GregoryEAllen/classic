<H1><CENTER>Introduction to Sonar</CENTER></H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Sonar, the acoustic analog to radar, is a method for
   detecting and locating objects using acoustic waves. It is often
   employed in environments where acoustic wave propagation is
   superior to electromagnetic wave propagation, such as under water.
   Sonar can be used for navigation, to identify hazardous or hostile
   objects, and to map terrain features in the surrounding
   environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>High-resolution sonars generally consist of an array of
   underwater sensors along with a
   <FONT COLOR="#660000">beamformer</FONT> to determine from which
   direction a sound is coming. The higher the resolution of a sonar
   system, the more accurately the location of an object can be
   determined. To achieve high resolution over a wide coverage area,
   a large number of beams may be formed. This figure illustrates a
   high resolution, multi-beam sonar with several narrow horizontal
   beams covering a wide horizontal sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The sensor element outputs must be combined to form these
   multiple narrow beams, each of which "looks" in a single direction
   and is insensitive to sound in neighboring directions. This
   combination must be performed with precise time delays and
   amplitude weighting applied to the sensor outputs. As a result,
   beamforming for high-resolution sonar systems is extremely
   computationally intensive.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1><CENTER>What is Beamforming?</CENTER></H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A beamformer is a spatial filter that operates on the
   output of an array of sensors in order to enhance the amplitude of
   a coherent wavefront relative to background noise and directional
   interference. The figure below shows a curved array of hydrophone
   sensors, or staves. Each sensor (red circle) is located at an
   (x,y) coordinate as shown. These sensors are pointed in known
   directions (blue arrows), and we wish to form beams which point in
   chosen directions (green arrows). The "pointing direction" is
   called the Maximum Response Angle (MRA), and can be arbitrarily
   chosen for the beams.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The response of a given element is plotted on a polar
   graph, where the angle is the offset from the MRA, and the radius
   is the magnitude response (dB) in that direction. Element
   responses (determined by the 3dB down point) are very wide -- in
   this example the width is about 90 degrees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The goal of beamforming is to sum multiple elements to
   achieve a narrower response in a desired direction (the MRA). That
   way when we hear a sound in a given beam, we know which direction
   it came from.

   <P>The <FONT COLOR="#660000">beamwidth</FONT> is the 3dB width of
   the main lobe. The <FONT COLOR="#660000">sidelobe level</FONT> is
   the level of the first sidelobe. A
   <FONT COLOR="#660000">null</FONT> is the region of low response
   between lobes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
